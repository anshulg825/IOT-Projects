# Air-Quality-Measurement

 We will use sensors to monitor dust particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide levels and this information can be shared with the public through smartphones, where the smartphone app allows people to monitor real-time data of the current air quality level in the area
 These sensors are connected to a microcontroller to control the sensors network. The data collected by the microcontroller is transmitted to the cloud for analysis. The analyzed data is shared to the public through a smartphone app
 For controlling these sensors, microcontrollers are used and the microcontrollers also act as transmitter to transmit the data to the cloud database
 Further we are planning to process this data using Data Analytics and Machine Learning 
 This processed data can be used for prediction of humidity , pollution , temperature for different seasons 

We need external codes or techniques for using Machine Learning based approach for prediction
