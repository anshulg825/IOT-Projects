Air Quality Measurement

Description

 We will use sensors to monitor dust particles, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide levels and this information can be shared with the public through smartphones, where the smartphone app allows people to monitor real-time data of the current air quality level in the area
 These sensors are connected to a microcontroller to control the sensors network. The data collected by the microcontroller is transmitted to the cloud for analysis. The analyzed data is shared to the public through a smartphone app
 For controlling these sensors, microcontrollers are used and the microcontrollers also act as transmitter to transmit the data to the cloud database
 Further we are planning to process this data using Data Analytics and Machine Learning 
 This processed data can be used for prediction of humidity , pollution , temperature for different seasons 

 This is a guide to data analytics basic functions

We need external codes or techniques for using Machine Learning based approach for prediction

Some references for similar projects:

Project 1

 Using blynk app
 Blynk is an Internet of Things (IoT) platform to control Arduino, Raspberry Pi and the like over the Internet
Things Required
 Arduino Uno ,Arduino Uno Ethernet shield, nova PM sensor SDS011, gas sensor MQ135, temperature and humidity sensor DHT11
 All the codes are available in the website

Project 2
link - https://electronicsforu.com/electronics-projects/esp32-based-air-quality-monitoring-system

Sensor - BME280 ,rest same as above
The project is based on ThingSpeak cloud computing. ThingSpeak is an open source IoT application and API to store and retrieve data from things using HTTP protocol over the Internet via LAN
If you send data from the sensors to ThingSpeak at regular intervals, it will create, store and display data in a trend automatically
Unfortunately the code file is corrupted , hopefully it will be restored

These set of projects are from arduino.cc (open-source), some of these have really good documentation :)

Project 3

This project is mostly similar to above 1 and 2 but this uses a different cloud website (devicehub.net)
